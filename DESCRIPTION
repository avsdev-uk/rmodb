Description: RMODB implements a metadata-object database for storing R 
             objects in MySQL. R objects are serialized into a binary memory
             buffer which is then written into a MySQL database along with 
             metadata such as creation timestamp, update timestamp, owner,
             title etc. The metadata fields are customisable on creation of the
             database. the metadata fields are cleartext and queryable allowing
             objects to be found and returned. On returning an object, it is
             de-serialised using the reverseof the serialize to binary memory
             process.
